**GOALS**   

Suppose we have a set of **feature** variables $(x_1,x_2,...,x_k)$ but NO outcome variable $y$. 

Instead of our goal being to predict/classify/explain $y$, we might simply want to...    

1. Examine the **structure** of our data.
2. Utilize this examination as a **jumping off point** for further analysis.




**UNSUPERVISED METHODS**

- **Cluster analysis**    
    - Focus: Structure among the *rows*, i.e. individual cases or data points.
    - Goal: Identify and examine *clusters* or distinct groups of cases with respect to their features x.    
    - Methods: hierarchical clustering & K-means clustering    


- **Dimension reduction**    
    - Focus: Structure among the *columns*, i.e. features x.
    - Goal: *Combine* groups of correlated features x into a smaller set of *uncorrelated* features which preserve the majority of information in the data. (We'll discuss the motivation later!)
    - Methods: Principal components
