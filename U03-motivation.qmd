# Motivating Question {.unnumbered}

<!-- mention "nonlinearity" -->

<!-- order of step_normalize and step_dummy changes preprocessing. Leslie keeps the dummies, not standardized dummies. so do many online. but the recommended order is to normalize AFTER: https://recipes.tidymodels.org/articles/Ordering.html. and julia silge does this as well: https://juliasilge.com/blog/tuition-resampling/ -->

**GOAL**    

We have a *quantitative* response variable $y$ and want to build a **predictive regression model** of $y$ using a bunch of potential predictors $x$.

**BUT**

The relationships between $y$ and $x$ are complicated, thus our existing modeling tools (e.g. least squares algorithm, LASSO) are too rigid. How can we build a **flexible** predictive regression model?

**Parametric vs nonparametric models**

The shared goal behind parametric and nonparametric regression models is to build a model of some quantitative response variable $y$ using predictors $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_p)$:

$$y = f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_p) + \varepsilon$$


- **parametric models**    
   Parametric regression models assume a specific "parametric" form for $f$. For example, a linear regression model assumes that $y$ is a linear combination of the predictors which is defined by *parameters* $\beta_i$:    
   $$y = f(x) + \varepsilon = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p + \varepsilon$$    
   BUT this assumption can be too *rigid* and *inflexible* to describe the relationship between $y$ and $x$.
   
- **nonparametric models**    
   *Nonparametric* models do NOT assume a parametric form for the relationship between $y$ and $x$, $f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_p)$. Thus they are more *flexible*.

**Common flexible regression models**

1. K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Local regression / locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) & generalized additive models (GAM)
3. Smoothing splines
