# Schedule {.unnumbered}

The schedule below is a tentative outline of our plans for the semester.

Before each class period, please watch the indicated videos and check on your understanding by actively reviewing the associated [Learning Goals](learning-objectives.html).

Readings refer to chapters/sections in the Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR) textbook (available online [here](https://www.statlearning.com/)). The ISLR readings are highly encouraged and serve as a nice complement to the videos and in-class activities.
