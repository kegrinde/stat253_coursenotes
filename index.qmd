# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

This is the course website for Statistical Machine Learning (STAT 253) at 
Macalester College for the Fall 2024 semester.

The site was built by [Kelsey Grinde](https://kegrinde.github.io).
It draws heavily upon our course textbook, the 2nd edition of 
[An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://www.statlearning.com/), as well as on materials prepared by fellow Macalester statistics faculty 
[Brianna Heggeseth](https://bcheggeseth.github.io), 
[Alicia Johnson](https://ajohns24.github.io), and 
[Leslie Myint](https://lmyint.github.io). 

The structure of this site was inspired by an [eCOTS 2024](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/ecots/ecots24) workshop led by Devin Becker: 
see [here](https://github.com/DB7-CourseNotes/QuorseNotes/tree/main) for materials.

*Note that this page will be under active construction throughout the semester.
