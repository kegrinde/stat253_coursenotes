This is the course website for Statistical Machine Learning (STAT 253) at Macalester College for Fall 2024.

The site was built by Macalester Professor [Kelsey Grinde](https://kegrinde.github.io).
It draws heavily upon our course textbook, the 2nd edition of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_corrected_June_2023.pdf.download.html), 
as well as on materials prepared by fellow Macalester Professors [Brianna Heggeseth](https://bcheggeseth.github.io), 
[Alicia Johnson](https://ajohns24.github.io), and [Leslie Myint](https://lmyint.github.io). 
The structure of this site was inspired by a [workshop](https://github.com/DB7-CourseNotes/QuorseNotes/tree/main) led by Dr. Devin Becker.
