## Question {-}    

The field of machine learning is most often associated with the building of **predictive models**, not *inferential models*. Specifically, the goal is to build a model which produces good predictions of our response variable $y$, not one that necessarily lends itself to testing specific hypotheses about $y$. In this case:

> If we have access to a bunch of potential predictors $x$, how can we decide which model to *build*?    


\


## Model Selection Methods {-}

1. **Variable selection**
    Identify a *subset* of predictors to use in our model of $y$.
    **Methods**: best subset selection, backward stepwise selection, forward stepwise selection

2. **Shrinkage / regularization**
    *Shrink* / regularize the coefficients of all predictors toward or to 0.
    **Methods**: LASSO, ridge regression, elastic net (a combination of LASSO & ridge)

3. **Dimension reduction**
    *Combine* the predictors into a smaller set of new predictors.
    **Methods**: principal components regression
